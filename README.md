# CS50 Final Project

## What is CS50?
CS50 is an introductory Computer Science class offered by Harvard.  The curriculum
covers a wide range of relevant topics and is a great place to start if you are new
to programming.  Each week, students complete projects that leverage the information 
learned and the culmination of the class is an open-ended final project.  This repo
is mine.

## The Application -- Spaced Repetition
This project will implement a spaced repetition learning system.  Spaced repetition 
is a technique for learning and information retention based on the work of Herman 
Ebbinghaus.  The idea is that information decays from our memories at a regular rate
unless it's reviewed regularly.  Through rigorous testing, Ebbinghaus determined a 
schedule for reviewing information that allows for much longer retention.  This app
helps with that.

## Usage
The application is pre-populated with questions from my CS50 course learning.  
However, you can add your own spaced repetition cards to tailor the experience 
to what you'd like to learn.  

## Why another system? 
There are other solutions out there.  Anki is a popular one, and open source.  But in
my opinion, the learning curve and user experience make it an awful solution.  Very few 
people need the powerful features that Anki provides.  This system is very
lightweight, easy to use, and enables people to quickly start learning.

## Hey Buck, why so many commits? 
Great question.  Most repositories have fewer, more meaningful commits.  If you're like me, 
though, and you're newer to programming and git in general, then there can be benefits to
so many small commits.  First, I have a limited amount of time every day to learn and apply
my programming knowledge, so I may only make very small changes on a daily basis.  Second, 
I'm learning git along the way and using it frequently helps.  Third, if you haven't read 
The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Just Showing Up Every Day, then do so.  Or do the 
#100DaysofCode challenge on Twitter.
